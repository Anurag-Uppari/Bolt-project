## 🌟 About the Project

### 🚀 Inspiration

The gaming industry is booming — but there's no dedicated platform where gaming professionals can **showcase their skills, connect with recruiters, and build careers**. GameNet was inspired by this gap, aiming to empower creators and developers through a **gamified career platform**.

> _“What if your gamer tag and achievements became your real-world portfolio?”_

GameNet merges community, creativity, and careers — all within an immersive, animated, and interactive UI environment.

### 📚 What We Learned

- Building a **UI-first experience** where design and function blend is both challenging and rewarding.
- **Cyberpunk UI** needs careful contrast, animation balance, and hover-feedback to feel real.
- Learned to use **React with TypeScript** for scalable component-based design.
- Experimented with **parallax, 3D layering**, and visual storytelling through motion.

---

### 🧗 Challenges Faced

- Combining **3D visual effects with responsive layouts**.
- Keeping performance smooth while using **layered animations**.
- Designing a **gamified dashboard** that’s professional yet fun.
- Time constraints meant backend and data logic is minimal — this is primarily a **UI/UX concept prototype**.
